1. Shot Quality: The heatmap can provide insights into the quality of shots taken by the team. Areas with higher shooting rates (warm colors) compared to the league average indicate that the team is taking more shots from those locations. This could suggest that they are finding better shooting opportunities or/and have players with strong shooting skills in those areas.
2. Offensive Strategy: The heatmap give an overview of the offensive strategy employed by a team for a season.
